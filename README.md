First casino project, still a work in progress but essentially i'd like to build something the younger crowd connects to better with an easier UI than what we see in today's average "slot" like simulated game project. My hope is to grab their attention via the bright and shiny shell, while also peaking their interest through the beautifully crafted UI that our grandparents could navigate if wanted. Any input would be greatly appreciated, I'll leave it open for now until the early days of final touches on this project, all work done via third party source will be credited in full and hence compensated if terms are met. will come and add from time to time as things improve, so let me have all the issues and pull requests to get this thihg optimized and going asap!
